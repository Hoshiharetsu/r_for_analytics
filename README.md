# Notebooks from DAT-204, Fall 2020

This is mostly here for the convenience of students who might not feel like fiddling with Jupyter notebooks in R. I'll put our files up as .md files, for ease of use. I'll put the notebooks up, too, but those are also in Blackboard.

While the actual writing of the notebooks is all mine (Coral Sheldon-Hess's), they were certainly influenced by Jordan Benis's slides from a previous semester's version of this course.
